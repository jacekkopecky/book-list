# Book List

A little program for keeping track of the books you have and want.

The main use case: the user (let's use the name Jo) is in a charity shop and finds an interesting book. Jo is not sure if they own the book already, or if they read it a long time ago (maybe from a library). Jo will buy the book but doesn't want to have it twice â€“ to prevent having two copies, Jo checks the app.

A book has these properties:

* title
* author (possibly omitted if unknown)
* series (if the book is part of a series)
* notes (anything the user might want to add for themself)
* whether the user owns or wants the book

## todo

* use id not title etc. for book key where available
* search functionality
* editing functionality
   - autocomplete/autosuggest matches for author / series
   - maybe drop-down of alphabetical list for author / series
* service worker for offline work, background sync
* better mobile interface
   - swipe book to change status or to edit
   - swipe between author and series view
* desktop interface with more columns of lists
* add dark mode? (see https://material-ui.com/customization/palette/#dark-mode )
* show books that are in the bin (sort by when binned? show when?), allow recovering, empty bin
* after save could go forward not back in history (see todo in BookEdit.tsx)
* top-level menu, about, version
* instead of whole-screen "saving", "adding", "deleting" these should be just a spinner over the "save" or "delete" button
* ci/cd deployment of server? (then fix notes below)

* resolved:
   - problem: books listed by author are not listed in order they should be read
   - solution: add first line of notes in collapsed book entry

## API

See [`docs/API.md`](docs/API.md) for documentation of the API.

## Server

The server is a Google cloud function; not deployed by CI/CD at the moment.

To deploy, you need to install the `gcloud` tools, configure at least the
_core/project_ and _functions/region_ settings, and do the following:

```sh
cd server # if not already there

npm ci
npm run deploy
```

To run a local testing version, you'll need `gcloud` and datastore emulator,
then run:

```sh
cd server # if not already there
npm run localds & # wait for the datastore emulator to start
npm run local
```
